# Cosmos DB Connectors Performance Testing and Results

## Test Environment

In order to easily and quickly deploy and tear-down the testing workloads, we've used a Kubernetes Cluster (specifically an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster) as the foundation. The following is a list of specifications for the AKS Cluster.

- 3 nodes each with VM flavor `Standard_F4s_v2`
- `Standard_F4s_v2` consists of 4 vCPUs, 8 GiB memory, 32 GB SSD storage. More info can be found in these [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/fsv2-series)
- Kubernetes Version: `1.19.6`
- Helm version: `v3.3.4`

### Kafka Installation

The main Kafka backend was installed via the upstream [Confluent Inc. helm charts](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-helm-charts) using the default values. However, only the following subset of the Kafka services were included in the installation:

- Kafka Brokers (3 replicas)
- ZooKeeper (3 replicas)
- Confluent REST Proxy
- Confluent Schema Registry

In addition, we installed Prometheus and Grafana to monitor relevant Kafka metrics. We used the upstream [Confluent Inc. dashboard template](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-helm-charts/tree/master/grafana-dashboard) to visualize the standard Kafka components in Grafana.

### Kafka Connect Installation

The connect cluster used for the performance testing consists of **three** workers (pods in the k8s context). Each worker pod has the following specifications:

- 2.66 CPUs (approx. 8 cores across all 3 workers)
- 2Gib Memory
- 2GB Heap

The worker pods are built with a [custom Docker image](../src/docker/Dockerfile), created using the upstream Kafka connect image as a base and the Cosmos DB connectors code installed on top.

The steps for installing Kafka and the Connect cluster can be found in this [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/kafka-connect-cosmosdb/tree/perf-testing/perf#deploy-kafka-and-kafka-connect-with-helm).

## Sink Connector Performance

### Sink Test setup

By sending load to a single kafka topic and setting up a sink connector on the same topic, we can test the performance of the connector. The target would be for the sink connector to keep up with the incoming traffic into the Kafka topic and stream these messages into Cosmos DB at the same rate.

#### Load Client and Cosmos Setup for Sink

We used the `kafka-producer-perf-test` CLI to generate load into a single Kafka topic. The load is also sent for a duration of 10 minutes. One thing to note is that load client is run as a pod in the same namespace that the Kafka pods are installed, so the traffic is sent via the local network.

- Single Topic
- Message Size: 100 Bytes of JSON data
- Topic throughput: 3000 Messages/sec, equating to 300 KB/s
- Number of topic partitions: 60
- Topic Replication factor: 3

We setup a Cosmos DB SQL Database with throughput fixed at 20K RU/s. Given the number of records sent during the load (3000 msgs/s), this throughput is ideal such that the Cosmos database won’t be throttling any requests.

#### Sink Connector Config

The main thing to note is that we’re using the same number of tasks (60) as the number of topic partitions (each topic should handle a single partition). We also added the `insertUUID` SMT to the connector since the load does not have any `id` fields that are required when creating records in Cosmos DB. More information about the `insertUUID` SMT can be found in the [Sink Connector documentation](./README_Sink.md#single-message-transforms).

```json

{
    "name": "cosmosdb-sink-connector",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "com.azure.cosmos.kafka.connect.sink.CosmosDBSinkConnector",
        "tasks.max": "5",
        "topics": "sink",
        "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
        "value.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
        "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
        "key.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
        "connect.cosmosdb.connection.endpoint": "<redacted>",
        "connect.cosmosdb.master.key": "<redacted>",
        "connect.cosmosdb.databasename": "kafkaconnect",
        "connect.cosmosdb.containers.topicmap": "sink#kafka",
        "transforms": "insertID",
        "transforms.insertID.type": "com.github.cjmatta.kafka.connect.smt.InsertUuid$Value",
        "transforms.insertID.uuid.field.name": "id"
    }
}

```

### Sink Test Results

The sink connector successfully handled the incoming load and alo transferred the messages at the same throughput into Cosmos DB. In the following graph obtained from Grafana, you can see the incoming messages rate steady out at 3000 msgs/sec during the middle of the test run.

![Sink Topic Messages Incoming Per Second](./images/perf-sink-kafka-chart.png "Sink Topic Messages Incoming Per Second")

In the Cosmos graph below, there are two data sources indicating the total Request Units and number of requests the Cosmos DB instance is processing **per minute**.

![Sink Performance Cosmos Usage](./images/perf-sink-cosmos-chart.png "Sink Performance Cosmos Usage")

For the selected time slice, the total RU usage was 1.13M and number of requests was 180K per minute, equating to about 19K RU/s and 3K requests/sec. Consequently, the number of requests per second to Cosmos is consistent with the number of messages sent into the Kafka topic, hence proving the sink connector keeping up with the total load.

## Source Connector Performance

### Source Test setup

The setup for the source test is similar to the sink but with an additional step. We'll still be sending load into a single Kafka topic and have a sink connector streaming these messages into a Cosmos DB container. Now, we'll setup a source connector to monitor the same Cosmos DB container and record any changes into a different Kafka topic. The goal is for the source connector to transfer messages from Cosmos DB into it's own topic at the same rate the sink connector is adding records into Cosmos DB (same as the rate as load is generated into the sink topic).

#### Load Client and Cosmos Setup for Source

We used the `kafka-producer-perf-test` CLI to generate load into a single Kafka topic for the sink connector. The load is also sent for a duration of 10 minutes.

- Single Topic (for sink connector)
- Message Size: 100 Bytes of JSON data
- Topic throughput: 150 Messages/sec, equating to 15 KB/s
- Number of topic partitions: 5
- Topic Replication factor: 3

The source connector then writes records into a separate Source topic.

- Single Source Topic (for source connector)
- Number of topic partitions: 1
- Topic Replication factor: 3

With a smaller number of records going into Cosmos DB but increased reads due to the source connector, this time we setup a Cosmos DB SQL Database with throughput fixed at 5K RU/s.

#### Sink and Source Connector Config

The sink connector is setup exactly the same as in the Sink performance tests but with only 5 maximum tasks this time.

```json

{
    "name": "cosmosdb-sink-connector",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "com.azure.cosmos.kafka.connect.sink.CosmosDBSinkConnector",
        "tasks.max": "5",
        "topics": "sink",
        "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
        "value.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
        "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
        "key.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
        "connect.cosmosdb.connection.endpoint": "<redacted>",
        "connect.cosmosdb.master.key": "<redacted>",
        "connect.cosmosdb.databasename": "kafkaconnect",
        "connect.cosmosdb.containers.topicmap": "sink#kafka",
        "transforms": "insertID",
        "transforms.insertID.type": "com.github.cjmatta.kafka.connect.smt.InsertUuid$Value",
        "transforms.insertID.uuid.field.name": "id"
    }
}

```

For the source connector, we have configured it to have 50 tasks monitoring the Cosmos DB container every 100ms. Note that the database name and container is identical to the ones from the sink connector above.

```json

{
    "name": "cosmosdb-source-connector",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "com.azure.cosmos.kafka.connect.source.CosmosDBSourceConnector",
        "tasks.max": "50",
        "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
        "value.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
        "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
        "key.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
        "connect.cosmosdb.task.poll.interval": "100",
        "connect.cosmosdb.offset.useLatest": false,
        "connect.cosmosdb.connection.endpoint": "<redacted>",
        "connect.cosmosdb.master.key": "<redacted>",
        "connect.cosmosdb.databasename": "kafkaconnect",
        "connect.cosmosdb.containers.topicmap": "source#kafka"
    }
}

```

### Source Test Results

The source connector was not able to transfer records from Cosmos DB to Kafka at the same rate the sink connector was putting into Cosmos. The graph below shows the number of messages going into the source record topic, plateauing at about 96 msgs/sec compared to the 150 msgs/sec going into Cosmos.

![Source Topic Incoming Messages Per Second](./images/perf-source-msgs-per-sec-chart.png "Source Topic Incoming Messages Per Second")

In the selected time slice of the Cosmos graph below, we see the total RU usage was 133.5K and number of requests was 28.5K per minute, equating to about 2.25K RU/s and 475K requests/sec.

![Source Performance Cosmos Usage](./images/perf-source-cosmos-chart.png "Source Performance Cosmos Usage")

For the same time slice in Grafana, the number of incoming messages into Kafka topics totalled 253 msgs/s. If we take away the message rate from the load client at 150 msgs/s, this rounds out to about 100 msgs/sec that are coming from the Source connector, which is consistent with the results from the first graph.
